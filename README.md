# redirect
This is a dynamic redirection page for link.dionperera.com / dion.gq. 

All requests will go through "404.html," as every request will have a different path. 
This website is a redirection page that will copy the path of the url, and use it with "bit.ly".

The redirection page will hold users for a few seconds before redirecting, allowing visitors to close the page before the redirection occurs. 

If you want a redirection page that copies the path of the URL, and uses that as the full URL (mydomain.com/http://example.com --> http://example.com), then check out my other repository (https://github.com/dionperera/redirect-url). 

The html redirection pages are customizable, only the javascript script (lines 21-26 on 404.html) need to remain the same. You can modify the script to another url, it redirects to bit.ly by default.
